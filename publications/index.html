However, the transition between these extremes, i.e., the low hydration regime, is still poorly understood at the molecular level and relevant to applications ranging from battery electrolytes to electrophoretic separations. In this study, we apply atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the role of hydration on ion mobilities and conductivities in LiTFSI-doped polyethers at low water content (less than 10% water by volume), which corresponds to 0−80% relative humidity conditions. With increasing water content, Li+ ions exhibit two distinct regimes in their mobilities. At low water content, the majority of the Li+ ions are weakly hydrated (two or fewer water molecules per Li+ ion), maintaining strong interactions with their polymer solvation cage, and therefore exhibit only a weak increase in mobility relative to dry conditions. As water content increases, Li+ ions form complete hydration shells, residing within water-rich domains that promote faster mobilities. Further, Li+ mobilities increase more significantly in polymer electrolytes composed of more hydrophilic polymers and higher salt concentrations due to the formation of larger water-rich domains. In contrast, TFSI− has comparatively weak interactions with both the polymer and water, exhibiting a monotonic increase in mobility as a function of water content. Overall, these results help clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying ionic mobilities and conductivities in polymer electrolytes at low water content.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Founta2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Understanding Charge Storage Mechanisms in Flexible Nanocellulose/Graphite Battery Electrodes</div> <div class="author">Evangelia Founta, Marina Carravetta, Michael Thielke, Ana Belen Jorge Sobrido,  <b><u>Leo W.

Despite the advancement of flexible Lithium‐ion (Li + ) batteries, achieving full adaptability requires redesigning individual battery components. Conventional graphite electrodes are used in Li + batteries but remain rigid and brittle, limiting applications in flexible energy storage. Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform. Five NCF/G battery electrode compositions with increasing NCF content (40–70 wt%) are fabricated via a straightforward aqueous route and are evaluated in Li + half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li + and NCF surface groups suggesting Li + diffusion through nanochannels. A perspective on the material‐driven reshaping of flexible NCF/G battery electrodes is provided, by investigating the contribution of NCF to charge storage mechanisms and to mechanical resilience. This study contributes to the development of battery electrodes that can be tailored to energy storage devices for emerging flexible electronics applications, and towards battery market diversification.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Kang2025" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Controlling Interlayer Disorder Toward Reversible Phase Transition in a Layered Sodium Manganese Oxide Cathode</div> <div class="author">Seongkoo Kang, Jihyun Kim, Youngju Choi, Suwon Lee,  <b><u>Leo W.

Most strategies to date have aimed to suppress the phase transitions by stabilizing their layered structures through limiting the content of extractable Na+. Here, we conversely increase atomic disorder in the Na-birnessite, a layered sodium manganese oxide, and thereby modulate its phase transition behavior toward improved electrochemical reversibility. Our study reveals that Mn vacancies and Mn migrated into the interlayer affect interlayer local environment of Na+ and water molecules consequently enhancing Na+ mobility. We observe better capacity retention for disordered “D-Na-birnessite”, which undergoes a reversible phase transition from the birnessite-type structure to an O′3-type α-NaxMnO2-like structure through another intermediate metastable birnessite-type phase.

In addition, inverse Haven ratios as high as 10 indicate positively correlated Li+ transport, possibly due to percolation of nanochannels that significantly improve battery-relevant conductivity.

Significant work on dry polymer electrolytes for batteries and highly swollen membranes for water purification has informed our understanding of ion transport under extreme conditions. However, knowledge of intermediate conditions (i.e., low hydration) is essential to emerging applications (e.g., electrolyzers, fuel cells, and lithium extraction). Ion transport under low levels of hydration is distinct from the extreme conditions typically investigated, and the relevant physics cannot be extrapolated from existing knowledge, stifling materials design. In this study, we conducted ion transport measurements in LiTFSI-doped polyethers that were systematically hydrated from dry conditions. A semiautomated apparatus that performs parallel measurements of water uptake and ionic conductivity in thin-film polymers under controlled humidity was developed. For the materials and swelling range considered in this study (i.e., \textless0.07 g water/g dry polymer electrolyte), ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on water uptake, with the initial sorbed water weakly affecting conductivity. With additional increases in swelling, more significant increases in conductivity were observed. Remarkably, changes in conductivity induced by water sorption were correlated with the number of water molecules per lithium ion, with the normalized molar conductivity of different samples effectively collapsing onto one another until this unit of hydration exceeded the solvation number of lithium ions under aqueous conditions. These results provide important knowledge regarding the effects of trace water contamination on conductivity measurements in polymer electrolytes and demonstrate that the lithium-ion solvation number marks a key transition point regarding the influence of water on ion transport in ion-containing polymers.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Asare2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Effects of ion mass transport on electrochemical reaction pathways in aluminum-anthraquinone batteries</div> <div class="author">Harrison Y.

However, different numbers of galvanostatic discharge plateaus have been observed in aluminum-quinone cells depending on the experimental conditions, a phenomenon that has not yet been explained and furthermore affects cell energy density. Here, in aluminum-anthraquinone batteries, we show that ion mass transport affects the electrochemical reaction pathway and controls the occurrence of either one or two reduction plateaus during galvanostatic discharge. The effects of electrode mass loading, porosity, rest periods, and cycling rates were analyzed on the reduction potential and relative specific capacity of the galvanostatic plateaus. When AlCl2+ cations charge compensate the electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups concurrently, a single reduction plateau is observed. When ion mass transport is limiting, sequential reduction and charge compensation of each carbonyl group results in two distinct reduction plateaus. The second plateau occurs at a potential approximately 0.3 V lower than the first, thus decreasing the cell energy density. The potential of the electrochemical oxidation reaction where AlCl2+ cations dissociate, however, is not affected. Ion mass transport is thus shown to be a critical variable that can control the electrochemical reaction pathway, redox potentials, and practical energy densities of aluminum-quinone batteries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Wang2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Ternary Ionic Liquid Analogues as Electrolytes for Ambient and Low-Temperature Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries</div> <div class="author">Jonah Wang, Theresa Schoetz,  <b><u>Leo W.

However, few studies have analyzed how the main electrochemical discharge product, LiF, evolves during the discharge and cell rest periods. To fill this gap in understanding, we investigated molecular-level and interfacial changes in CF<sub>x</sub> electrodes upon the discharge and aging of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> cells, revealing the role of LiF beyond that of a simple discharge product. We reveal that electrochemically formed LiF deposits on the surface of the CF<sub>x</sub> electrode and subsequently partially disperses into the electrolyte to form a colloidal suspension during cell aging, as determined from galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), solid-state <sup>19</sup>F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and operando optical light microscopy measurements. Electrochemical LiF formation and LiF dispersion into the electrolyte are distinct competing rate processes that each affect the cell impedance differently. Using knowledge of LiF dispersion and saturation, an in-line EIS method was developed to compute the depth of discharge of CF<sub>x</sub> cells beyond coulomb counting. Solid-state <sup>19</sup>F NMR measurements quantitatively revealed how LiF and CF moieties evolved with discharge. Covalent CF bonds react first, followed by a combination of covalent and ionic CF bonds. Quantitively correlating NMR and electrochemical measurements reveals not only how LiF formation affects cell impedance but also that CF bonds with the most ionic character remain unreacted, which limits realization of the full theoretical specific capacity of the CF<sub>x</sub> electrode. The results reveal new insights into the electrochemical discharge mechanism of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> cells and the unique role of LiF in cell discharge and aging, which suggest pretreatment strategies and methods to improve and measure the performance of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> batteries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Leung2024" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Solid Polymer Electrolytes with Enhanced Electrochemical Stability for High-Capacity Aluminum Batteries</div> <div class="author">Oi Man Leung,  <b><u>Leo W.

Progress in aluminum batteries is currently hindered by the limited electrochemical stability, corrosivity, and moisture sensitivity of these ionic liquids.

In aluminum–graphite cells, the solid polymer electrolytes enable charging to 2.8 V, achieving a maximum specific capacity of 194 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 66 mA g<sup>–1</sup>. Long-term cycling at 2.7 V showed a reversible capacity of 123 mA h g<sup>–1</sup> at 360 mA g<sup>–1</sup> and 98.4% coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles.

However, at low temperatures, Zn batteries typically suffer from high electrolyte viscosity and unfavorable ion transport properties. Here, we studied reversible Zn electrodeposition in mixtures of 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMIm]TFSI) ionic liquid, γ-butyrolactone (GBL) organic solvent, and Zn(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> zinc salt. The electrolyte mixtures enabled reversible Zn electrodeposition at temperatures as low as −60 °C. An electrolyte composed of 0.1 M Zn(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> in [EMIm]TFSI:GBL with a volume ratio of 1:3 formed a deep eutectic solvent that optimized electrolyte conductivity, viscosity, and the zinc diffusion coefficient.

Aluminum metal batteries typically use electrolytes based on chloroaluminate ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents that are comprised of polyatomic aluminum-containing ions. Quinone-based organic electrodes store charge when chloroaluminous cations (AlCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) charge compensate their electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups, even when such cations are not natively present in the electrolyte. However, how ion speciation in the electrolyte affects the ion charge storage mechanism, and resultant battery performance, is not well understood. Here, we couple solid-state NMR spectroscopy with electrochemical and computational methods to show for the first time that electrolyte-dependent ion speciation significantly alters the molecular-level environments of the charge-compensating cations, which in turn influences battery properties. Using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) for the first time as an organic electrode material, we utilize dipolar-mediated solid-state NMR experiments to elucidate distinct aluminum coordination environments upon discharge that depend significantly on electrolyte speciation. We relate DFT-calculated NMR parameters to experimentally determined quantities, revealing insights into their origins. The results establish that electrolyte ion speciation impacts the local environments of charge-compensating chloroaluminous cations and is a crucial design parameter for rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2022</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Roy2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Formation of a CoMn‐Layered Double Hydroxide/Graphite Supercapacitor by a Single Electrochemical Step</div> <div class="author">Atanu Roy, Theresa Schoetz,  <b><u>Leo W.

The ultimate capacitive material is graphite (GR), yet high capacitance is usually not achieved due to restacking of its sheets. Therefore, an appealing approach to achieve high power and energy systems is to embed a faradaic 2D material in between the graphite sheets. Here, a simple one-step approach was developed, whereby a faradaic material [layered double hydroxide (LDH)] was electrochemically formed inside electrochemically exfoliated graphite. Specifically, GR was exfoliated under negative potentials by Co(II) and, in the presence of Mn(II), formed GR-CoMn-LDH, which exhibited a high areal capacitance and energy density. The high areal capacitance was attributed to the exfoliation of the graphite at very negative potentials to form a 3D foam-like structure driven by hydrogen evolution as well as the deposition of CoMn-LDH due to hydroxide ion generation inside the GR sheets. The ratio between the Co(II) and Mn(II) in the CoMn-LDH was optimized and analyzed, and the electrochemical performance was studied. Analysis of a cross-section of the GR-CoMn-LDH confirmed the deposition of LDH inside the GR layers. The areal capacitance of the electrode was 186 mF cm<sup>–2</sup> at a scan rate of 2 mV s<sup>–1</sup>. Finally, an asymmetric supercapacitor was assembled with GR-CoMn-LDH and exfoliated graphite as the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, yielding an energy density of 96.1 μWh cm<sup>–3</sup> and a power density of 5 mW cm<sup>–3</sup>.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Gordon2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Molecular-Scale Elucidation of Ionic Charge Storage Mechanisms in Rechargeable Aluminum–Quinone Batteries</div> <div class="author"> <b><u>Leo W.

However, the ionic charge storage mechanisms occurring in aluminum–organic batteries are currently not well understood, in part because of the diversity of possible charge-balancing cations, coupled with a wide array of possible binding modes. For the first time, we use multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemical methods to elucidate experimentally the ionic and electronic charge storage mechanism in an aluminum–organic battery up from the atomic length scale. In doing so, we present indanthrone quinone (INDQ) as a positive electrode material for rechargeable aluminum batteries, capable of reversibly achieving specific capacities of ca. 200 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 0.12 A g<sup>–1</sup> and 100 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 2.4 A g<sup>–1</sup> . We demonstrate that INDQ stores charge via reversible electrochemical enolization reactions, which are charge compensated in chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes by cationic chloroaluminous (AlCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ) species in tetrahedral geometries. The results are generalizable to the charge storage mechanisms underpinning anthraquinone-based aluminum batteries. Lastly, the solid-state dipolar-mediated NMR experiments used here establish molecular-level interactions between electroactive ions and organic frameworks while filtering mobile electrolyte species, a methodology applicable to many multiphase host–guest systems. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Zhang2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Performance Leap of Lithium Metal Batteries in LiPF<sub>6</sub> Carbonate Electrolyte by a Phosphorus Pentoxide Acid Scavenger</div> <div class="author">Jian Zhang, Jiayan Shi,  <b><u>Leo W.

However, Al-S batteries exhibit many challenges that plague other metal-sulfur battery systems, including significant capacity fade of the sulfur electrode due to the formation of electrolyte-soluble reaction intermediates. Here, Al-S cells using chloroaluminate-containing ionic liquid electrolytes were investigated up from the molecular level using multidimensional solid-state <sup>27</sup>Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical measurements. Solid-state <sup>27</sup>Al single-pulse NMR measurements acquired on cycled sulfur electrodes containing electrolyte-soaked separator revealed multiple discharge products, which were distinguished into liquid- and solid-phase products based on <sup>27</sup>Al chemical exchange and nutation NMR experiments. During discharge, electrolyte-soluble sulfide species form that coordinate with the AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>–</sup> chloroaluminate anions, resulting in (S<sub>x</sub>AlCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>y–</sup> electrolyte complexes.

These properties, however, are often characteristic of either batteries (high specific energy) or capacitors (high specific power and cyclability). To merge battery- and capacitor-like properties in a hybrid energy storage system, researchers must understand and control the co-existence of multiple charge storage mechanisms. Charge storage mechanisms can be classified as faradaic, capacitive, or pseudocapacitive, where their relative contributions determine the operating principles and electrochemical performance of the system. Hybrid electrochemical energy storage systems can be better understood and analyzed if the primary charge storage mechanism is identified correctly. This tutorial review first defines faradaic and capacitive charge storage mechanisms and then clarifies the definition of pseudocapacitance using a physically intuitive framework. Then, we discuss strategies that enable these charge storage mechanisms to be quantitatively disentangled using common electrochemical techniques. Finally, we outline representative hybrid energy storage systems that combine the electrochemical characteristics of batteries, capacitors and pseudocapacitors.
