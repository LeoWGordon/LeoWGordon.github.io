title: ACS Macro Letters Paper Published
description: Our recent paper led by James Bamford demonstrates the improvements in mechanical strength after adding nickel salts to a coordinating, imidazole-containing polymer. The study demonstrates that even with addition of NiTFSI<sub>2</sub> up to r=0.16, ionic conductivity of Li<sup>+</sup> is not strongly affected, however, the increase in mechanical stiffness is notable as a result of dynamic crosslinking of imidazole functionalities with Ni<sup>2+</sup>. This demonstrates that ion transport and bulk mechanics can be decoupled by the addition of multivalent metal cations to polymers with chelating ligands.
