description: It was a great experience attending my first in-person ENC, and what a huge difference it makes to get to be with everyone in person again! I heard a number of interesting talks, saw some great poster presentations, and met many new, wonderful, and fascinating people. Can't wait for the next one!

Attending this year's ENC was a highly memorable experience, full of interesting science and lasting memories! I was very happy to be awarded the student travel stipend from Norell, which supported me to present my work on modifications for lithium metal battery electrolytes. I had a lot a great engagement with my work from all over, both from people within the field and from some with no relation to batteries. I'm thankful for all the new people I met, and hope to keep in touch â€“ I'll see you at the next one!
