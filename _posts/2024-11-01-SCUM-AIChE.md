title: Presentations at SCUM and AIChE
description: In a very busy week, I had the opportunity to present at both the Southern California Users of Magnets (SCUM) meeting, and the American Institute for Chemical Engineers (AIChE) annual meeting. At SCUM 2024, I presented some of the new work from our group using spatially-resolved NMR methods for direct measurements of thermodynamic phenomena, namely partitioning. I demonstrated this capability through measurements of the octanol-water partitioning coefficients of different solutes, in addition to using NMR profilometry to visualise intensity maps of water moving across membranes. At AIChE, I was proposing my research vision as a faculty candidate. AIChE was an excellent opportunity to meet and network with my peers across a range of disciplines, I always cherish attending talks outside of my comfort zone! For anyone I met this week, please stay in touch. I'm always happy to discuss research, especially ways to incorporate NMR spectroscopy into your work!
