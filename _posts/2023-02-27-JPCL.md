description: The latest work from our group "Reversible Zinc Electrodeposition at −60 &#8451 Using a Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Low-Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries" was published today. In this work we demonstrate an electrolyte with a deep-eutectic point to enable reversible zinc electrodeposition down to temperatures of -60 &#8451. We make 0.1 M Zn(TFSI)<sub>2</sub> electrolytes in different ratios of [EMIm]TFSI with gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) which are probed electrochemically to determine their macroscopic properties, and further analysed at the molecular level via NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explain the differences in performance from an atomistic approach.
