Our paper in collaboration with the Juchen Guo group (UC Riverside): "Performance Leap of Lithium Metal Batteries in LiPF<sub>6</sub> Carbonate Electrolyte by a Phosphorus Pentoxide Acid Scavenger" was published in ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces today. This work is a culmination of excellent performance of lithium metal batteries and deep, mechanistic understanding. We go beyond just showing the long cycle lifetimes achieved by the addition of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> and show the SEI composition, the electrolyte species present, and develop a feasible reaction mechanism to describe the pathway to producing the moieties responsible for the performance enhancement. The paper can be accessed [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.2c09267).
