title: Starting as Assistant Professor in DTU Chemistry
description: Today I have begun my faculty journey, starting as a new assistant professor in the chemistry department at the Danish Technical University (DTU). My group, the Magnetic Resonance and Electrochemistry (MR-e) Lab, will combine the worlds of magnetic resonance tools like NMR spectroscopy and MRI with electrochemical methods for the purpose of studying battery materials. Our goal is to build a deeper understanding of electrolytes by non-invasively probing them under non-equilibrium conditions, thereby enabling us to capture valuable insights of systems not at rest.
