I was awarded a travel stipend to present my work on modified lithium-metal battery electrolytes at the Experimental Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Conference (ENC) this April. This is my first presentation of liquid-state NMR work that was performed in collaboration with the Guo group at UC Riverside and I'm excited to share this thorough study of performance enhancing modifications to liquid electrolytes for lithium-metal batteries.
