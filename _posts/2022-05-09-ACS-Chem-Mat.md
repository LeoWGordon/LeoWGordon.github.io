title: ACS Chemistry of Materials Paper Published
description: Our ACS Chemistry of Materials paper entitled "Soluble Electrolyte-Coordinated Sulfide Species Revealed in Al–S Batteries by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy", led by Dr. Rahul Jay and Dr. Ankur Jadhav, was published. The study probed the different species present through solid-state NMR techniques on a multiphase sample containing both solid and liquid and species. The final paper can be found at [this link](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.chemmater.2c00248)
