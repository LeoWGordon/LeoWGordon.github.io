description: An investigation of eutectic electrolyte mixtures for low-temperature aluminium batteries led by Jonah Wang was published today. This work uses a combination of NMR spectroscopy and electrochemical methods to understand the electrolyte speciation and monitor the cycling performance, both for electrodeposition, and also in aluminium-graphite cells. We show operation down to -40 &#8451 in the ternary AlCl<sub>3</sub>-urea-[EMIm]Cl mixture at a mole ratio of 1.3-0.25-0.75. In addition to supressing the freezing point, the addition of urea to the binary mixture of AlCl<sub>3</sub>-[EMIm]Cl improves the cost effectiveness of such electrolytes.

[An investigation](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsaem.4c00739) of eutectic electrolyte mixtures for low-temperature aluminium batteries led by Jonah Wang was published today. This work uses a combination of NMR spectroscopy and electrochemical methods to understand the electrolyte speciation and monitor the cycling performance, both for electrodeposition, and also in aluminium-graphite cells. We show operation down to -40 Â°C in the ternary AlCl<sub>3</sub>-urea-[EMIm]Cl mixture at a mole ratio of 1.3-0.25-0.75. In addition to supressing the freezing point, the addition of urea to the binary mixture of AlCl<sub>3</sub>-[EMIm]Cl improves the cost effectiveness of such electrolytes.
