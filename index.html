Progress in aluminum batteries is currently hindered by the limited electrochemical stability, corrosivity, and moisture sensitivity of these ionic liquids. Here, a solid polymer electrolyte based on 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride-aluminum chloride, polyethylene oxide, and fumed silica is developed, exhibiting increased electrochemical stability over the ionic liquid while maintaining a high ionic conductivity of ≈13 mS cm−1. In aluminum–graphite cells, the solid polymer electrolytes enable charging to 2.8 V, achieving a maximum specific capacity of 194 mA h g−1 at 66 mA g−1. Long-term cycling at 2.7 V showed a reversible capacity of 123 mA h g−1 at 360 mA g−1 and 98.4% coulombic efficiency after 1000 cycles. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements reveal the formation of five-coordinate aluminum species that crosslink the polymer network to enable a high ionic liquid loading in the solid electrolyte. This study provides new insights into the molecular-level design and understanding of polymer electrolytes for high-capacity aluminum batteries with extended potential limits.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Gordon2023" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Revealing impacts of electrolyte speciation on ionic charge storage in aluminum-quinone batteries by NMR spectroscopy</div> <div class="author"> <b><u>Leo W Gordon</u></b>, Jonah Wang, and Robert J Messinger </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Magnetic Resonance</em> <p>Mar 2023</p> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/Gordon2023_Preprint.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries are composed of earth-abundant, sustainable electrode materials while the molecular structures of the organic materials can be controlled to tune their electrochemical properties. Aluminum metal batteries typically use electrolytes based on chloroaluminate ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents that are comprised of polyatomic aluminum-containing ions. Quinone-based organic electrodes store charge when chloroaluminous cations (AlCl2+) charge compensate their electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups, even when such cations are not natively present in the electrolyte. However, how ion speciation in the electrolyte affects the ion charge storage mechanism, and resultant battery performance, is not well understood. Here, we couple solid-state NMR spectroscopy with electrochemical and computational methods to show for the first time that electrolyte-dependent ion speciation significantly alters the molecular-level environments of the charge-compensating cations, which in turn influences battery properties. Using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) for the first time as an organic electrode material, we utilize dipolar-mediated solid-state NMR experiments to elucidate distinct aluminum coordination environments upon discharge that depend significantly on electrolyte speciation. We relate DFT-calculated NMR parameters to experimentally determined quantities, revealing insights into their origins. The results establish that electrolyte ion speciation impacts the local environments of charge-compensating chloroaluminous cations and is a crucial design parameter for rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Gordon2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Molecular-Scale Elucidation of Ionic Charge Storage Mechanisms in Rechargeable Aluminum–Quinone Batteries</div> <div class="author"> <b><u>Leo W.

However, the ionic charge storage mechanisms occurring in aluminum–organic batteries are currently not well understood, in part because of the diversity of possible charge-balancing cations, coupled with a wide array of possible binding modes. For the first time, we use multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemical methods to elucidate experimentally the ionic and electronic charge storage mechanism in an aluminum–organic battery up from the atomic length scale. In doing so, we present indanthrone quinone (INDQ) as a positive electrode material for rechargeable aluminum batteries, capable of reversibly achieving specific capacities of ca. 200 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 0.12 A g<sup>–1</sup> and 100 mAh g<sup>–1</sup> at 2.4 A g<sup>–1</sup> . We demonstrate that INDQ stores charge via reversible electrochemical enolization reactions, which are charge compensated in chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes by cationic chloroaluminous (AlCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ) species in tetrahedral geometries. The results are generalizable to the charge storage mechanisms underpinning anthraquinone-based aluminum batteries. Lastly, the solid-state dipolar-mediated NMR experiments used here establish molecular-level interactions between electroactive ions and organic frameworks while filtering mobile electrolyte species, a methodology applicable to many multiphase host–guest systems. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Zhang2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Performance Leap of Lithium Metal Batteries in LiPF<sub>6</sub> Carbonate Electrolyte by a Phosphorus Pentoxide Acid Scavenger</div> <div class="author">Jian Zhang, Jiayan Shi,  <b><u>Leo W.

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements reveal the detailed reaction mechanisms of P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with the LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte and its impurities, which removes hydrogen fluoride (HF) and difluorophosphoric acid (HPO<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>) and produces phosphorus oxyfluoride (POF<sub>3</sub>), OF<sub>2</sub>P–O–PF<sub>5</sub>– anions, and ethyl difluorophosphate (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OPOF<sub>2</sub>) as new electrolyte species. The P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-modified LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolyte is chemically compatible with a Li metal anode and LiNi<sub>0.6</sub>Mn<sub>0.2</sub>Co<sub>0.2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (NMC622) cathode, generating a PO<sub>x</sub>F<sub>y</sub>-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) that leads to highly reversible Li electrodeposition, while eliminating transition metal dissolution and cathode particle cracking. The excellent electrochemical properties of the P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>-modified LiPF<sub>6</sub> electrolytes are demonstrated on Li||NMC622 pouch cells with 0.4 Ah capacity, 50 μm Li anode, 3 mAh cm<sup>–2</sup> NMC622 cathode, and 3 g Ah<sup>–1</sup> electrolyte/capacity ratio. The pouch cells can be galvanostatically cycled at C/3 for 230 cycles with 87.7% retention. </p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"></div> <div id="Schoetz2022" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Disentangling Faradaic, Pseudocapacitive, and Capacitive Charge Storage: A Tutorial for the Characterization of Batteries, Supercapacitors, and Hybrid Systems</div> <div class="author">T.

These properties, however, are often characteristic of either batteries (high specific energy) or capacitors (high specific power and cyclability). To merge battery- and capacitor-like properties in a hybrid energy storage system, researchers must understand and control the co-existence of multiple charge storage mechanisms. Charge storage mechanisms can be classified as faradaic, capacitive, or pseudocapacitive, where their relative contributions determine the operating principles and electrochemical performance of the system. Hybrid electrochemical energy storage systems can be better understood and analyzed if the primary charge storage mechanism is identified correctly. This tutorial review first defines faradaic and capacitive charge storage mechanisms and then clarifies the definition of pseudocapacitance using a physically intuitive framework. Then, we discuss strategies that enable these charge storage mechanisms to be quantitatively disentangled using common electrochemical techniques. Finally, we outline representative hybrid energy storage systems that combine the electrochemical characteristics of batteries, capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Modern examples are analyzed while step-by-step guides are provided for all mentioned experimental methods in the Supplementary Information.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%6C%77%67%6F%72%64%6F%6E@%75%63%73%62.%65%64%75" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8242-9470" title="ORCID" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-orcid"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z1UnPzgAAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leo-Gordon-2/" title="ResearchGate" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-researchgate"></i></a> <a href="https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=57615157900" title="Scopus" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-scopus"></i></a> <a href="https://github.com/LeoWGordon" title="GitHub" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i></a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-gordon" title="LinkedIn" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a> </div> <div class="contact-note"> Please reach out via email to learn more about me! </div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Leo W.
