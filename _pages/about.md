[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/pdf/Leo_CV.pdf)

I am a postdoctoral scholar in the [Cl√©ment group](https://clement.materials.ucsb.edu) at UC Santa Barbara where I investigate ion transport processes in polymeric materials using NMR methodologies such as pulsed-field gradient and electrophoretic NMR. I recently completed my Ph.D. research at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/chemeng) (CCNY) working in the field of energy storage materials where I was advised by [Prof. Robert J. Messinger](https://batteries-for-space.ccny.cuny.edu).

The primary focus of my Ph.D. was using NMR characterisation techniques to determine charge storage mechanisms and to understand electrolyte speciation. Solid-state NMR is my main tool for investigating charge storage, which I apply to understand ionic and electronic charge storage mechanisms in organic electrodes for rechargeable aluminium batteries. I also have expertise in liquid NMR, which I have demonstrated through my work on lithium metal battery electrolytes, along with molten salt electrolytes for aluminum batteries. I have further interests in metal anode surface chemistries, lithium cathode recycling, and the nuances of charge storage with different molten salt electrolyte speciations. My central PhD work has culminated in publications including articles in the [Journal of Physical Chemistry C](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.2c04272), [ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.2c09267), and the [Journal of Magnetic Resonance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090780723000095).

Before joining the Chemical Engineering department at CCNY, I attained an integrated Masters degree in Chemistry (MChem) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.chem.ed.ac.uk), Scotland. During my thesis research I worked to develop and understand novel designs for multi-microelectrode arrays for electrochemical sensing applications. Also during the bachelors portion of my degree, I briefly investigated dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) using plant derived dyes, targeting low-cost and minimally corrosive materials.

In my free time I enjoy bouldering to keep fit, and to make time-saving GUI programs to process data - many of which can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/LeoWGordon)!
