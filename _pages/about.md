I am a 4th year PhD student at [The City College of New York](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/chemeng) (CCNY) working in the field of energy storage materials where I am advised by [Prof. Robert J. Messinger](https://batteries-for-space.ccny.cuny.edu).

My primary focus is using NMR characterisation techniques to determine charge storage mechanisms and to understand electrolyte speciation. Solid-state NMR is my main tool for investigating charge storage, which I apply primarily to the problem of organic electrodes in rechargeable aluminium batteries. I also have expertise in liquid NMR, which I have demonstrated through my work on lithium metal battery electrolytes. I have further interests in metal anode surface chemistries, and the nuances of charge storage with different aluminium electrolyte speciations.

Before joining the Chemical Engineering department at CCNY, I attained an integrated Masters degree in Chemistry (MChem) from the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.chem.ed.ac.uk), Scotland. During my thesis research I worked to develop and understand novel designs for multi-microelectrode arrays for electrochemical sensing applications. Also during the bachelors portion of my degree, I briefly investigated dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) using plant derived dyes, targeting low-cost and minimally corrosive materials.

In my free time I enjoy bouldering to keep fit, and to make time-saving GUI programs to process data - many of which can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/LeoWGordon)!
