To achieve a full 6-electron capacity of selenium electrodes in aluminium batteries, it is imperative that the Se(0) to Se(–II) is attainable as well as the Se(0) to Se(IV) reactions. This paper documents the viability of the selenium to aluminium selenide electrochemical reduction in glassy selenium, which is seldom observed with crystalline trigonal selenium. This paper challenges the naive assumption that aluminium batteries using sulfur and selenium cathodes would operate in the same way. While both are chalcogens, the bonding topologies of elemental selenium and sulfur are quite different in their most stable forms (trigonal Se chains vs. 8-membered S rings) and this leads to differences in their electrochemical performances. <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/Al-Se_ToC-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/Al-Se_ToC-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/Al-Se_ToC-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/Al-Se_ToC.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row">Jan 14, 2024</th> <td> Recently a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/aenm.202303285" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">collaborative work</a> with Oi-Man Leung at the Unversity of Southampton was published in Advanced Energy Materials.

This is a detailed analysis of the ionic charge storage mechanisms in aluminium-quinone batteries where we begin by detailing the speciation of three different Lewis acidic ionic liquid/ionic liquid analogue electrolytes by liquid-state NMR, we then use solid-state NMR to determine the nature of the complexed ions upon electrochemical discharge in each electrolyte. We further use DFT calculations to both determine the most favorable electroactive cation generation pathways and to link the experimentally derived NMR quadrupolar parameters to a physical basis of ion interaction with different quinone structures. Finally, we also validate our hypothesised mechanisms with targeted experiments, proving the function of various ionic species. <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset=" /assets/img/DCQ_ToC_Figure-480.webp 480w, /assets/img/DCQ_ToC_Figure-800.webp 800w, /assets/img/DCQ_ToC_Figure-1400.webp 1400w, " sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/DCQ_ToC_Figure.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </td> </tr> <tr> <th scope="row">Sep 28, 2022</th> <td> The 4th battery and energy storage conference, taking place this year in CUNY’s very own Advanced Science and Research Center building, was a fast-paced and highly engaging few days.
