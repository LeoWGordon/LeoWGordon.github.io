In collaboration with the [John Group](http://gjohn.ccny.cuny.edu) at CCNY we have been developing understanding of electrochemical ion complexation to organic molecules, with a specific focus on quinone-type organics.

Our current goal is to understand from the basic level, what chemical and electronic effects substituents have on the fused aromatic ring system of anthraquinone and how we can tune these organic molecules for optimal performance. Our aim is to develop this fundamental understanding before oligomerising/polymerising these molecules to mitigate issues due to solubility.

In currently working aluminum battery electrolytes, it appears that the majority of charged species being stored are not necessarily multivalent. Unfortunately due to issues of the aluminum metal anode in aqueous electrolytes ([another project of interest in our lab]({% link _projects/Al_Interface.md %})), attaining the full 3+ charge from aluminum is difficult to achieve from an aluminum-metal battery.

We have studied anthraquinone-based cathodes extensively in aluminum-metal battery systems, and we are further investigating the generalisability to zinc-aqueous batteries.
The zinc-organic battery investigation is underway as an undergrad project in Spring 2022.
