NMR is at the heart of our group. We use many techniques across both solid- and liquid-state NMR to learn about and characterise energy storage materials.

I favour the use of dipolar-mediated correlation experiments. Many of the systems I work with are proton-rich, allowing the transfer of magnetisation from the proton 'bath' to other spin-active nuclei within sub-nanometer distances. The dipolar coupling constant scales with the inverse of the internuclear distance cubed $$D \propto \frac{1}{r^{3}}$$, therefore is an effective through-space probe for complexed ions such as aluminium in organic battery systems. The spin-locking time can also be modulated to approximate through-bond interactions if needed.

The systems studied in our lab have covered a wide range of different nuclei, including: <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>7</sup>Li, <sup>11</sup>B, <sup>13</sup>C, <sup>19</sup>F, <sup>27</sup>Al, <sup>29</sup>Si, <sup>31</sup>P, <sup>67</sup>Zn, <sup>77</sup>Se, <sup>207</sup>Pb, among others.
