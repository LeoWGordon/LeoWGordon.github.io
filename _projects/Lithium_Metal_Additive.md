Lithium metal batteries using liquid electrolytes often suffer from dendritic growths leading to short circuiting of the cells. In addition liquid carbonate electrolytes for lithium batteries are prone to decomposition, forming HF. Our additive scavenges HF and residual water which might form further HF, and also produces a stable and favourable SEI layer on the lithium surface, enabling smooth plating and stripping.
