title: Partitioning and Transport via NMR
description: Using NMR spectroscopy, we are able to directly measure thermodynamic phenomena such as octanol-water partitioning coefficients. Ultimately, we aim to monitor partitioning from a liquid phase to a membrane phase with time resolution to establish mechanistic insights to the transport modes across the membrane.

As part of the [MWET EFRC](https://mwet.utexas.edu), we have been developing expertise in spatially-resolved NMR methods that enable us to measure and monitor thermodynamic and transport phenomena both in solution and in membranes.

We are able to directly quantify solute partitioning between phases via comparison of peak ratios between spatially-resolved NMR measurements. This reduces the amount of assumptions required in the analysis and this was reflected in the results, which faithfully reproduced the literature values of log(K<sub>ow</sub>) for a number of solutes.

Ideally, we will be able to expand the measurements from spatially-resolved intensity profiles along the z-axis of an NMR tube that enable us to measure transport at the macroscopic scale, to microscopic measurements of solute diffusion specifically within the membrane phase.
