Beyond aluminium, we also maintain an interest in zinc battery chemistries for its 2+ multivalent charge and compatibility in aqueous systems. We pair zinc anodes with organic electrodes and study their charge storage mechanisms. This work will be done in Spring 2022 with the help of an undergraduate research assistant.
