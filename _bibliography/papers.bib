	abstract = {Ion transport properties in polymer electrolytes have been widely studied under rigorously dry and highly waterswollen conditions. However, the transition between these extremes, i.e., the low hydration regime, is still poorly understood at the molecular level and relevant to applications ranging from battery electrolytes to electrophoretic separations. In this study, we apply atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to probe the role of hydration on ion mobilities and conductivities in LiTFSI-doped polyethers at low water content (less than 10\% water by volume), which corresponds to 0−80\% relative humidity conditions. With increasing water content, Li+ ions exhibit two distinct regimes in their mobilities. At low water content, the majority of the Li+ ions are weakly hydrated (two or fewer water molecules per Li+ ion), maintaining strong interactions with their polymer solvation cage, and therefore exhibit only a weak increase in mobility relative to dry conditions. As water content increases, Li+ ions form complete hydration shells, residing within water-rich domains that promote faster mobilities. Further, Li+ mobilities increase more significantly in polymer electrolytes composed of more hydrophilic polymers and higher salt concentrations due to the formation of larger water-rich domains. In contrast, TFSI− has comparatively weak interactions with both the polymer and water, exhibiting a monotonic increase in mobility as a function of water content. Overall, these results help clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying ionic mobilities and conductivities in polymer electrolytes at low water content.},

Here, this limitation is addressed by integrating nanocellulose (NCF), a nanoscale biopolymer, with graphite (G), to yield an intrinsically flexible electrode platform.

              half cells. Beyond serving as a flexible substrate enduring 180° bending deformation, NCF is shown to actively enhance ion transport for a 60 wt\% NCF optimal content. Electrode nanoarchitecture further improves electrochemical characteristics, by implementing electrospun NCF. Molecular‐level insights reveal proximity of Li

	abstract = {Sodium manganese oxides are promising Na-ion battery cathodes but they suffer from irreversible phase transitions during electrochemical reactions. Most strategies to date have aimed to suppress the phase transitions by stabilizing their layered structures through limiting the content of extractable Na+. Here, we conversely increase atomic disorder in the Na-birnessite, a layered sodium manganese oxide, and thereby modulate its phase transition behavior toward improved electrochemical reversibility. Our study reveals that Mn vacancies and Mn migrated into the interlayer affect interlayer local environment of Na+ and water molecules consequently enhancing Na+ mobility. We observe better capacity retention for disordered “D-Na-birnessite”, which undergoes a reversible phase transition from the birnessite-type structure to an O′3-type α-NaxMnO2-like structure through another intermediate metastable birnessite-type phase. This research highlights the positive effects of atomic disorder to regulate phase transition routes for achieving superior electrochemical reversibility, finally paving the way to overcoming the limits of layered oxide cathodes.},

However, conventional SPEs have fundamental limitations in terms of Li+ conductivity. While an imidazole functionalized polymer (PMS-Im) has been previously shown to have ionic conductivity related to the imidazole-Li+ coordination, herein we demonstrate that quaternization of this polymer to form an analogous imidazolium functionalized polymer (PMS-Im+) more efficiently solvates lithium salts and plasticizes the polymer. In addition, inverse Haven ratios as high as 10 indicate positively correlated Li+ transport, possibly due to percolation of nanochannels that significantly improve battery-relevant conductivity. From these combined effects, Li+ conductivity in PMS-Im+ (2.1 × 10−5 S/cm) is over an order of magnitude greater than in PMS-Im at 90 °C (1.6 × 10−6 S/cm).},

	abstract = {Ion-containing polymers are subject to a wide range of hydration conditions across electrochemical and water treatment applications. Significant work on dry polymer electrolytes for batteries and highly swollen membranes for water purification has informed our understanding of ion transport under extreme conditions. However, knowledge of intermediate conditions (i.e., low hydration) is essential to emerging applications (e.g., electrolyzers, fuel cells, and lithium extraction). Ion transport under low levels of hydration is distinct from the extreme conditions typically investigated, and the relevant physics cannot be extrapolated from existing knowledge, stifling materials design. In this study, we conducted ion transport measurements in LiTFSI-doped polyethers that were systematically hydrated from dry conditions. A semiautomated apparatus that performs parallel measurements of water uptake and ionic conductivity in thin-film polymers under controlled humidity was developed. For the materials and swelling range considered in this study (i.e., {\textless}0.07 g water/g dry polymer electrolyte), ionic conductivity depends nonlinearly on water uptake, with the initial sorbed water weakly affecting conductivity. With additional increases in swelling, more significant increases in conductivity were observed. Remarkably, changes in conductivity induced by water sorption were correlated with the number of water molecules per lithium ion, with the normalized molar conductivity of different samples effectively collapsing onto one another until this unit of hydration exceeded the solvation number of lithium ions under aqueous conditions. These results provide important knowledge regarding the effects of trace water contamination on conductivity measurements in polymer electrolytes and demonstrate that the lithium-ion solvation number marks a key transition point regarding the influence of water on ion transport in ion-containing polymers.},

	abstract = {Aluminum anodes and quinone-based organic cathodes couple as earth abundant, sustainable, and safe battery electrodes. However, different numbers of galvanostatic discharge plateaus have been observed in aluminum-quinone cells depending on the experimental conditions, a phenomenon that has not yet been explained and furthermore affects cell energy density. Here, in aluminum-anthraquinone batteries, we show that ion mass transport affects the electrochemical reaction pathway and controls the occurrence of either one or two reduction plateaus during galvanostatic discharge. The effects of electrode mass loading, porosity, rest periods, and cycling rates were analyzed on the reduction potential and relative specific capacity of the galvanostatic plateaus. When AlCl2+ cations charge compensate the electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups concurrently, a single reduction plateau is observed. When ion mass transport is limiting, sequential reduction and charge compensation of each carbonyl group results in two distinct reduction plateaus. The second plateau occurs at a potential approximately 0.3 V lower than the first, thus decreasing the cell energy density. The potential of the electrochemical oxidation reaction where AlCl2+ cations dissociate, however, is not affected. Ion mass transport is thus shown to be a critical variable that can control the electrochemical reaction pathway, redox potentials, and practical energy densities of aluminum-quinone batteries.},

However, few electrolytes can reversibly electrodeposit Al metal, especially at low temperatures. In this study, Al electroplating and stripping were investigated from 25 $\,^{\circ}$C to −40 $\,^{\circ}$C in mixtures of aluminum chloride (AlCl3), 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium chloride ([EMIm]Cl), and urea. The ternary ionic liquid analogue (ILA) consisting of AlCl3-urea-[EMIm]Cl in a molar ratio of 1.3:0.25:0.75 enabled reversible Al electrodeposition at temperatures as low as −40 $\,^{\circ}$C while exhibiting the highest current density and the lowest overpotential among all of the electrolyte mixtures at 25 $\,^{\circ}$C, including the AlCl3-[EMIm]Cl binary mixture. The ILA electrolyte was further tested in a rechargeable Al-graphite battery system down to −40 $\,^{\circ}$C. The addition of urea to AlCl3-[EMIm]Cl binary mixtures can improve the Al electrodeposition, extend the liquid temperature window, and reduce the cost.},

	abstract = {Fifty years after its introduction, the lithium-carbon monofluoride (Li-CF<sub>x</sub>) battery still has the highest cell-level specific energy demonstrated in a practical cell format. However, few studies have analyzed how the main electrochemical discharge product, LiF, evolves during the discharge and cell rest periods. To fill this gap in understanding, we investigated molecular-level and interfacial changes in CF<sub>x</sub> electrodes upon the discharge and aging of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> cells, revealing the role of LiF beyond that of a simple discharge product. We reveal that electrochemically formed LiF deposits on the surface of the CF<sub>x</sub> electrode and subsequently partially disperses into the electrolyte to form a colloidal suspension during cell aging, as determined from galvanostatic electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), solid-state <sup>19</sup>F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and operando optical light microscopy measurements. Electrochemical LiF formation and LiF dispersion into the electrolyte are distinct competing rate processes that each affect the cell impedance differently. Using knowledge of LiF dispersion and saturation, an in-line EIS method was developed to compute the depth of discharge of CF<sub>x</sub> cells beyond coulomb counting. Solid-state <sup>19</sup>F NMR measurements quantitatively revealed how LiF and CF moieties evolved with discharge. Covalent CF bonds react first, followed by a combination of covalent and ionic CF bonds. Quantitively correlating NMR and electrochemical measurements reveals not only how LiF formation affects cell impedance but also that CF bonds with the most ionic character remain unreacted, which limits realization of the full theoretical specific capacity of the CF<sub>x</sub> electrode. The results reveal new insights into the electrochemical discharge mechanism of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> cells and the unique role of LiF in cell discharge and aging, which suggest pretreatment strategies and methods to improve and measure the performance of Li-CF<sub>x</sub> batteries.},

@article{Roy2022,
	abstract = {Hybrid electric storage systems that combine capacitive and faradaic materials need to be well designed to benefit from the advantages of batteries and supercapacitors. The ultimate capacitive material is graphite (GR), yet high capacitance is usually not achieved due to restacking of its sheets. Therefore, an appealing approach to achieve high power and energy systems is to embed a faradaic 2D material in between the graphite sheets. Here, a simple one-step approach was developed, whereby a faradaic material [layered double hydroxide (LDH)] was electrochemically formed inside electrochemically exfoliated graphite. Specifically, GR was exfoliated under negative potentials by Co(II) and, in the presence of Mn(II), formed GR-CoMn-LDH, which exhibited a high areal capacitance and energy density. The high areal capacitance was attributed to the exfoliation of the graphite at very negative potentials to form a 3D foam-like structure driven by hydrogen evolution as well as the deposition of CoMn-LDH due to hydroxide ion generation inside the GR sheets. The ratio between the Co(II) and Mn(II) in the CoMn-LDH was optimized and analyzed, and the electrochemical performance was studied.

	abstract = {Rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries are composed of earth-abundant, sustainable electrode materials while the molecular structures of the organic materials can be controlled to tune their electrochemical properties. Aluminum metal batteries typically use electrolytes based on chloroaluminate ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents that are comprised of polyatomic aluminum-containing ions. Quinone-based organic electrodes store charge when chloroaluminous cations (AlCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>) charge compensate their electrochemically reduced carbonyl groups, even when such cations are not natively present in the electrolyte. However, how ion speciation in the electrolyte affects the ion charge storage mechanism, and resultant battery performance, is not well understood. Here, we couple solid-state NMR spectroscopy with electrochemical and computational methods to show for the first time that electrolyte-dependent ion speciation significantly alters the molecular-level environments of the charge-compensating cations, which in turn influences battery properties. Using 1,5-dichloroanthraquinone (DCQ) for the first time as an organic electrode material, we utilize dipolar-mediated solid-state NMR experiments to elucidate distinct aluminum coordination environments upon discharge that depend significantly on electrolyte speciation. We relate DFT-calculated NMR parameters to experimentally determined quantities, revealing insights into their origins. The results establish that electrolyte ion speciation impacts the local environments of charge-compensating chloroaluminous cations and is a crucial design parameter for rechargeable aluminum-organic batteries.},

	abstract = { Rechargeable aluminum--organic batteries are of great interest as a next-generation energy storage technology because of the earth abundance, high theoretical capacity, and inherent safety of aluminum metal, coupled with the sustainability, availability, and tunabilty of organic molecules. However, the ionic charge storage mechanisms occurring in aluminum--organic batteries are currently not well understood, in part because of the diversity of possible charge-balancing cations, coupled with a wide array of possible binding modes. For the first time, we use multidimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy in conjunction with electrochemical methods to elucidate experimentally the ionic and electronic charge storage mechanism in an aluminum--organic battery up from the atomic length scale. In doing so, we present indanthrone quinone (INDQ) as a positive electrode material for rechargeable aluminum batteries, capable of reversibly achieving specific capacities of ca. 200 mAh g<sup>--1</sup> at 0.12 A g<sup>--1</sup>  and 100 mAh g<sup>--1</sup>  at 2.4 A g<sup>--1</sup> . We demonstrate that INDQ stores charge via reversible electrochemical enolization reactions, which are charge compensated in chloroaluminate ionic liquid electrolytes by cationic chloroaluminous (AlCl<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ) species in tetrahedral geometries. The results are generalizable to the charge storage mechanisms underpinning anthraquinone-based aluminum batteries. Lastly, the solid-state dipolar-mediated NMR experiments used here establish molecular-level interactions between electroactive ions and organic frameworks while filtering mobile electrolyte species, a methodology applicable to many multiphase host--guest systems. },

	abstract = {Rechargeable aluminum-sulfur (Al-S) batteries have recently garnered significant interest to the low cost, earth abundance, safety, and high theoretical capacity of the electrode materials. However, Al-S batteries exhibit many challenges that plague other metal-sulfur battery systems, including significant capacity fade of the sulfur electrode due to the formation of electrolyte-soluble reaction intermediates. Here, Al-S cells using chloroaluminate-containing ionic liquid electrolytes were investigated up from the molecular level using multidimensional solid-state <sup>27</sup>Al MAS NMR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrochemical measurements. Solid-state <sup>27</sup>Al single-pulse NMR measurements acquired on cycled sulfur electrodes containing electrolyte-soaked separator revealed multiple discharge products, which were distinguished into liquid- and solid-phase products based on <sup>27</sup>Al chemical exchange and nutation NMR experiments. During discharge, electrolyte-soluble sulfide species form that coordinate with the AlCl<sub>4</sub><sup>--</sup> chloroaluminate anions, resulting in (S<sub>x</sub>AlCl<sub>4</sub>)<sup>y--</sup> electrolyte complexes. These electrolyte-coordinated sulfide species persist upon charge, resulting in the loss of active mass that explains the significant capacity fade observed upon galvanostatic cycling. XPS, XRD, and solid-state <sup>27</sup>Al NMR measurements reveal that solid amorphous Al<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> forms reversibly upon discharge. The results highlight the technological importance of understanding how electrolyte-soluble sulfide species coordinate with the complex electroactive species used in multivalent metal-sulfur batteries, which can affect their reversibility and electrochemical properties.},

	abstract = {Today's electrochemical energy storage technologies aim to combine high specific energy and power, as well as long cycle life, into one system to meet increasing demands in performance. These properties, however, are often characteristic of either batteries (high specific energy) or capacitors (high specific power and cyclability). To merge battery- and capacitor-like properties in a hybrid energy storage system, researchers must understand and control the co-existence of multiple charge storage mechanisms. Charge storage mechanisms can be classified as faradaic, capacitive, or pseudocapacitive, where their relative contributions determine the operating principles and electrochemical performance of the system. Hybrid electrochemical energy storage systems can be better understood and analyzed if the primary charge storage mechanism is identified correctly. This tutorial review first defines faradaic and capacitive charge storage mechanisms and then clarifies the definition of pseudocapacitance using a physically intuitive framework. Then, we discuss strategies that enable these charge storage mechanisms to be quantitatively disentangled using common electrochemical techniques. Finally, we outline representative hybrid energy storage systems that combine the electrochemical characteristics of batteries, capacitors and pseudocapacitors. Modern examples are analyzed while step-by-step guides are provided for all mentioned experimental methods in the Supplementary Information.},
